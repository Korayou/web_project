# First Player Picker

This project is a Progressive Web App, which uses native Touch Gestures, Vibration and Pointer Device Adaptation.  
The goal of this PWA is to help groups of people to chose someone among them. For example, when trying to figure out who is gonna start a game.  
The device needs to integrate a tactile screen (such as a phone or a tablet).  
Each member of the group places a finger on the screen, and acquires a color. After 3 seconds, the entire app background takes the color of the chosen player. Each interaction and result is notified by vibrations, if the device and the user allow it.
