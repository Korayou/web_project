# First Player Picker

[Web Page here !](https://glittering-cendol-e482f5.netlify.app/)  
This project is a Progressive Web App, which uses native Touch Gestures, Vibration and Pointer Device Adaptation.  
The goal of this PWA is to help groups of people to chose someone among them. For example, when trying to figure out who is gonna start a game.  
The device needs to integrate a tactile screen (such as a phone or a tablet).  
Each member of the group places a finger on the screen, and receive a color. After 3 seconds, the entire app background takes the color of the chosen player. Each interaction and result is notified by vibrations, if the device and the user allow it.  
  
  
I (the developer) unfortunately didn't went as far as I wanted on this project. I wished to add a "non tactile" version of this picker, by pressing different keys of a keyboard instead of putting fingers on a screen.  
For this project, which is originally to use native web features, I started with a 3D game, with a gyroscope controlled spaceship. The gyroscope input were unfortunately too imprecise, causing lag or delay, and impacting the game experience. I chose to change the concept, creating a usefull tool, and a more appreciable experience. The first concept took me time I couldn't use for the final one.
